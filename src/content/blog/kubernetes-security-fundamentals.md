## Start with the Basics

Use namespaces to isolate workloads and apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) so that developers and services only get the permissions they need.

## Enforce Least Privilege

Run containers as nonâ€‘root and restrict capabilities. Admission controllers like Gatekeeper or Kyverno can enforce these policies automatically.

## Monitor and Patch

Enable audit logging, aggregate it centrally, and keep your images and nodes patched. Vulnerability scanners should be part of your CI pipeline.

## Automate Policy

Define security policies as code and test them like any other component. Automation keeps guardrails consistent across environments.

## Conclusion

A secure cluster doesn't require a massive team. With a few focused practices, your Kubernetes platform can stay resilient while your engineers keep shipping features.
