## Set the Scope

Pick a single feature or service and gather the people who know it best. Time-box the session to keep everyone focused.

## Map the Data Flow

Sketch how data moves through the system. Simple boxes and arrows are enough to reveal trust boundaries.

## Identify Threats

Ask what could go wrong at each step. Use STRIDE or attack stories to guide the conversation.

## Prioritize and Act

Record the top issues, assign owners, and track mitigation in the backlog so fixes ship with the product.
