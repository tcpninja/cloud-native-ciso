## Our Mission

Cloud Native CISO was created for founders and engineering leaders who are building fast and need security that keeps up. We focus on practical guidance that helps teams protect their product and customers without slowing development.

## Why Cloud Native Security Matters

Modern applications run on containers, serverless functions, and managed services. These platforms move quickly and so do attackers. Building security into the foundation of your startup is cheaper and easier than bolting it on later.

## Focus Areas

We publish playbooks and tools across six core domains:

- **Cloud Native Security** – securing Kubernetes, containers, and cloud infrastructure
- **Incident Readiness** – preparing for the breach before it happens
- **Threat Modeling** – lightweight methods to reason about risk
- **Identity & Access** – implementing least privilege and Zero Trust
- **AI & LLM Security** – safeguarding applications that leverage AI
- **Templates & Playbooks** – copy‑paste resources to move fast

## Join the Community

Sign up for updates and share your challenges. Together we can raise the security bar for every cloud‑native startup.
