## Why This Matters

Kubernetes is powerful â€” but dangerous if misconfigured. Early-stage companies often skip security under pressure to ship. This guide helps you shift left **without blocking speed**.

## TL;DR

- Lock down workloads with **Pod Security Admission** (PSA)
- Use **Network Policies** to segment traffic
- Enable **Audit Logging** in your managed Kubernetes service
- Leverage **OPA/Gatekeeper** for policy enforcement

## 1. Use Pod Security Admission (PSA)

```yaml title="PodSecurityPolicy.yaml"
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: baseline-policy
spec:
  privileged: false
  runAsUser:
    rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
