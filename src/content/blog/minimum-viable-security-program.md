## Define Critical Assets

List the systems and data that would harm the business if compromised. This clarity helps you focus limited resources.

## Pick Guardrails

Start with a few high-impact controls: multi-factor authentication, infrastructure as code with reviews, and backups that are tested.

## Track and Iterate

Create a simple dashboard of risks and owners. Review it monthly to celebrate wins and address gaps as the company grows.

## Conclusion

Security programs evolve, but an initial foundation lets you scale confidently and proves to investors and customers that you take protection seriously.
