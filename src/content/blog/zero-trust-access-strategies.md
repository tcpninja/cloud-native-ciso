## Know Your Identities

Inventory human and service accounts. Group them by function so you can manage policies consistently.

## Use Strong Authentication

Adopt multi-factor authentication for all admin access and favor short-lived credentials issued by your identity provider.

## Segment Everything

Network policies and cloud security groups limit lateral movement. Treat every component as if it were on the public internet.

## Continuously Verify

Log every access request and feed the data into detection tools. Regular reviews catch privilege creep before it becomes a problem.
