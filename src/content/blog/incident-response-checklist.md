## Preparation

Designate an incident commander, define communication channels, and keep contact details for legal counsel, cloud providers, and partners handy.

## Detection

Enable centralized logging and alerting. Know who watches the dashboards and how to escalate suspicious activity.

## Containment and Eradication

Have playbooks for isolating affected systems, rotating credentials, and removing malicious artifacts.

## Recovery and Lessons Learned

Verify that services are functioning normally, notify stakeholders, and capture action items to strengthen defenses.
